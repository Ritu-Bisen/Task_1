# Overview of the project
## Project : Simple Calculator Using Java<br/>
### Objective

Building a simple calculator in Java involves creating a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieving this:

#Setup Development Environment:

Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or set up a simple text editor with command-line compilation.
Create a new Java class, for example, SimpleCalculator.
Gather User Input:

Use Java’s Scanner class to read input from the user. This input will include two numbers and an operator.

#Perform Calculations:

Based on the operator provided by the user, perform the appropriate arithmetic operation. Use a switch statement or if-else conditions to handle different operators.


#Display Results:

Print the result of the calculation to the console, formatting the output for clarity.

#Handle Errors:

Ensure that the calculator handles potential errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid operator input.

#Summary
This simple calculator example in Java covers the essentials of reading user input, performing basic arithmetic operations, and displaying results. 
It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and can be expanded with additional features such as advanced operations or a graphical user interface (GUI).
